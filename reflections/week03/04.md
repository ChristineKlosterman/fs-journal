> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

It makes your code more reusable by tying it to a lot of objects to update the page more

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The observer looks for things that have changed and you change things by sending them through the proxystate so they work hand in hand to listen for changing information
