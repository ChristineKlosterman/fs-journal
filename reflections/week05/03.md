## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is when you plan your coding into blocks of time so you don't spend too much time stuck on a problem. You can use it for other things besides coding but it helps you say on a schedule.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Ruthless apply, practice and adapt, and prioritize.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I think I could use timeboxing more all the time when I write code. I tend to get distracted with a problem and spend a long time on it. I think even on this assignment I could've timeboxed.
