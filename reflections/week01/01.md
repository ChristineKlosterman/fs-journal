## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

When there are several people working on one project together they need to have a way to revert back to old code whenever it's called for. When you're a developer you may need to change versions of code because you may not know if eveeryone is on the same version as you. Every time you commit into git it saves the code and that version of the code.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Having multiple branches means you can have one main branch that is tested to work, and other branches for playing around with. Developers can make another branch to test an idea without worrying about screwing up the code that already runs smoothly.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system and github is a place where you can share code snippets and projects. Git is also saved on your local system while Github saves to the cloud.
