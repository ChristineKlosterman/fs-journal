## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    Pseudo classes are classes on CSS that come after the colon (:). hover is one that's commonly used to change a link or button when hovering over it.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

    Specificity is how important a command is to the language. you can make something the most most important by writing !important.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If two things are very important and they're on the same class you can't write !important because it will clash with each other and not work.
