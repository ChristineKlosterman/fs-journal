## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
    
    Outlining the website so it's easier to figure out what you want to do when you code it.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

    There's containers, buttons, text and different color options. Each component helps visualize the website.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    
    I think it can really help if you're working with a team of designers and they can show you what exactly they want. You can also send a mockup website to a client before you start building it to see if they like it. Yes I think it's worth it.
