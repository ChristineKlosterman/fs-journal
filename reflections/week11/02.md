## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys represent uinique data that can't be repeated and foreing keys reference other tables.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is something you can rename something to when you are calling a table so that you can shorten the name of what you're calling temporarily.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
  FOREIGN KEY (id) FROM patients
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)


```
