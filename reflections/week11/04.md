## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I really enjoyed seeing what I never thought I could do. Everyone is so friendly and great, It's really nice that the school is willing to help us so much. I thought that coding would be too hard for me to learn so I never pursued it but I'm really glad that I could finally build something and feel proud of the things I've done.
