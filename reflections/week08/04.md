## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

There is Unit Testing, component testing, and end to end testing or E2E. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think first class error reporting is the most useful, because not only do I use that all the time, Jake uses it. Getting errors back is extremely useful to debugging.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I don't think any of the ways to test are ingerintly bad. I may just not use them as much as first class error reporting. The vue utils is good I just don't use it thqat often, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
