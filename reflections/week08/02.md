## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Good communication reduces the time you need to organize in the future. When you're on a small team you're going to have to do the same thing a big team would do in the same amount of time, so saving time on organizing and reorganizing is important. 


2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Small teams may not be assigned one job. Everyone might have to jump around to pick up the slack of not having a bigger team.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unnatainable triangle is basically good, fast, and cheap. Basically if it's cheap it will be done slowly, if it's good it will be done expensive and slowly, and if it's fast it will be done badly or expensive.
