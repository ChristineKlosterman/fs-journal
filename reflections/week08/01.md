## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

A developer portfolio will help you apply for companies and get a job. Recruiters will look at the portfolio and see if they want to reach out to you or not. 

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Having projects that stand out. The more quality projects you have the more likely a company will want to hire you.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I will definitely include the current capstone I'm working on because it's meant to show off our fullstack capabilities. The Tower is another fullstack that I would put in. I think I will also include the APOD because I really liked the idea of that project, but maybe flesh it out a bit.
