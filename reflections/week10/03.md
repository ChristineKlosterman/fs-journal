## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?


the information in a row is one objects and the information in a column can be many objects returned from a table.


2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
  id int NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name string,
  age int,
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
Drop table deletes a table and delete deletes all the rows in the table not the table itself.
