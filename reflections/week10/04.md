## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enum is a value that can be entered from a list of created values.


2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can use the ALTER MODIFY command to add a new value to a column on a table.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

You can use enums to specify a set of connected values like 1-10, east west south north, anything like that so you can just access the enum instead of accessing each value on the table separately.
