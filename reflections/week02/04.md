## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Coding is a lot about critical thinking. There's many ways to get to one answer like solving a math problem or winning a game of chess. Making a plan before-hand is like sketching a thumbnail before painting the picture.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I like to sit back, or take a walk and talk to myself in my hed or outloud to see if I missed anything obvious. If that doesn't work I go through my code to see if I've done anything similar to what I'm trying to work. Last resort I google, watch youtube, or ask for help.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
I assumed that if anything worked it would be the "right" way to do things but I guess that's not true. Although as a beginner I wouldn't know if what I write is correct or not. I only know if it works or doesnt.
