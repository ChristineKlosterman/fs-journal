## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log('this is used to put anything to the console and is nice to use when debugging or checking if a function is working.');

Window.alert('this is used to bring up a checkbox and you can write whatever you want on it. It is good to use when making sure someone wanted to buy/delete something.');


2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

If you control click on the page it will bring up the dev tools. The elements tab shows the HTML.


3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

If you write debugger into your JavaScript it will bring up the debugger tool which shows you what's happening in your code line by line.
