## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
A scope is what determines where you can access variables and when. there's two types of scopes which is the local scope and the global scope. Local scopes are declared inside a function and can only be accessed in that functions. Global variables are declared outside of a function and can be accessed anywhere.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a way to move the declaration of code before it's written. By doing this you can make the function or variable run before it was actually written.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Let is good for declaring variables that you want to change in a function. Const is good for making an object or an array that will not change in declaration. 
Var isn't good for anything anymore. Use let.
