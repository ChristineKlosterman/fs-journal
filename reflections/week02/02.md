## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?


function name(parameters) {
This is a function declaration, it is named so it is hoisted and can be declared before it was writted.
}

let name = function(parameters) {
This is a function expression it cannot be hoisted because it defines a function that is already named.
}
let name = (parameters) => {
   This is an arrow function. It is a short way of writing a function expression. Allegedly.
}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
 Arguments are independant variables, constants, booleans, etc that contain data. When an argument is put into a function it is called a parameter. Parameters are what go into the parantheses of a function to pass something through the function. They help define a function. 


3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
A higher order function accepts functions as parameters or returns a function.
